## Introduction

Here I'm going to answer on next question: Does drinking beer make you more attractive to mosquitos?

Idea based on [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=672&v=5Dnw46eC-0o)

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
